// This one is really interesting, because you can't use any loop or recursion.
// I've tried the log function and judged if the outcome is an interger or not, but it doesn't work.
// Because the program itself has the accuracy error, e.g. 5 is 4.999999999999991, we can't get interger even if the result is true.
// And I tried to control the accuracy, but it always failed when n is very large.
